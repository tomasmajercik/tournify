## Tournify: mobile app for creating, finding and managing tournaments

### üìù Project description
This project was one of the most complete projects we‚Äôve built - a fully functional React Native application for organizing, discovering, and managing sports tournaments. The idea came from wanting to modernize how local tournaments are run: instead of messy paper sign-ups and group chats, we envisioned a mobile-first platform that could handle everything in one place.
We built the app from scratch using Expo and React Native, integrating user registration, tournament creation, team management, QR code ticketing, maps, and real-time leaderboards. The backend provided all the data, and the app communicated with it through protected API calls using token-based authentication.

What made this project especially rewarding was how polished and production-ready it became. From offline caching to dynamic forms and role-based interactions, it felt like building a real-world product, not just a school project. It gave us a chance to connect frontend design with real backend logic - and see how it all ties together in a seamless user experience.
